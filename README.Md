## Project Virtual Credit Card

### The goal of this project is to practice working with HTML and CSS

We will be using HTML, CSS, icons, background images to build a virtual credit card

**Basic functionality:** The purpose is to build a template like credit card with a hover animation for both site visibility .


This is what the app will look like, using the icons and images in the starter code of the project (see assets folder):  

<img src="/sample front.png" width="600" />Â 
<img src="/sample back.png " width="600" />Â 

---

### For starters

1. Create a new folder on your local computer with the name: project-virtual-credit-card-app
1. Track your code with Git by using `git init` in the terminal
1. Create an index.html file with the general template code
1. Create a style.css file and add this to your HTML file as `<link>` (check how to add CSS to an HTML file)
1. Make sure you have *Virtual Credit Card* as the title (this will show in the tab when your app runs in the browser)
1. For the background color,you can  use this `linear-gradient(45deg,#0045c7,#ff2c7d)` or any of your preferred color
1. The icons and background image you need for the webpage are in the assets folder (but feel free to search for others you would like to use)
1. Build the page according to the example. You can use Flexbox to position the elements in the right place, if you know how to use it (there is a project called **flexbox-practice** in the CodeWomen repositories, if you would like to get better at using Flexbox)
1. Feel free to use Bootstrap if you also want to practise that ðŸ˜Š
1. Add hover effect in order to rotate the card **180 degree** to see the backsite 
1. **Hover hint** use `transform,transition,perspective` properties of CSS.
1. You can run the app in the browser with LiveServer (a VSC extension)

## Please note:
If you want to download a project on your local machine, do not fork it but clone the repo locally, on your computer. After that, create a new repo in your own GitHub account *with exactly the same project name*, and link the local repo to the remote repo in your GitHub account (see below). Why should you clone and not fork? It will show the project as **your own project** and not a fork of someone else's project. You can use it as a project for your portfolio.

You can connect a local project to a new, empty GitHub repo [as follows](https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line). We can do this together during a CodeWomen coding session: it is very good to know this so that you can start a project locally and afterwards link it with a remote GitHub repo.

If you clone the project without forking it, you will have to change the 'remote origin' repository after cloning. Check the remote of your local project using `git remote -v`. You will probably see:  
`origin  https://github.com/CodeWomen-Barcelona/some-codewomen-project.git (fetch)`  
`origin  https://github.com/CodeWomen-Barcelona/some-codewomen-project.git (push)`

To link your local project to your own GitHub repo, you need to change the remote origin. Have a look at this article: https://devconnected.com/how-to-change-git-remote-origin/. With `git remote -v` you can again check if remote origin has been reset and now shows the name of your GitHub account.
